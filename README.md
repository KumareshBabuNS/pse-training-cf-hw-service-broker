PS@E Training - Cloud Foundry "Hello World" Service Broker module

This module showcases Cloud foundry service broker concepts. It includes both a presentation and a lab portion.

Both the presentation and lab slide decks are included here.

The lab describes the use of a sample "Hello world" (Java Spring) service broker and the service it fronts.
This is accompanied by the projects that provide their sample implementations:

1. A simple Hello World service - which serves as the 'service backend' for:
2. A simple Hello World service broker - which will need to be registered with your Cloud Foundry deployment's Cloud Controller

(Both project are based on a trimmed down copy of the orginal Spring service broker 'template' as provided [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/spring-service-broker))
